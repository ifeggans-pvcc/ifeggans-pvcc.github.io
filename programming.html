        <ul>
            <li>Phase 1: Understand the problem.</li>
            <li>Phase 2: Design an algorithm to solve the problem.</li>
            <li>Phase 3: Write the program code in appropriate language based on the algorithm.</li>
            <li>Phase 4: Enter the program and save.</li>
            <li>Phase 5: Execute the program.</li>
            <li>Phase 6: Test the program, find errors and debug, then retest.</li>
            <li>Phase 7: Document and evalute the program.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Two classic programming/database problems:</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Sorting: </br>
            - Descending order/Ascending order</br>
            - Sorting numbers</br>
            - Sorting strings (in accordance with ASCII values)
        </li>
        <li>Searching:</br>
            - Find specific data that meet a certain criteria</br>
            In database:</br>
            -Filters: Temporary search</br>
            -Queries: Search criteria are saved so they don't have to be recreated. 
            </li>
        </ol>

        <h2>Two popular search techniques:</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Sequential search: Search from top to bottom or bottom to top, one item at a time.</li>
            <li>Binary search: Only works if data is sorted first. </br>
                - Start in the middle, then go to half of that, etc.</li>
        </ol>

        <h2>Two classic program goals:</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Efficiency: Program takes minimal time and/or resources.</li>
            <li>Correctness: Program runs in expected ways and works for all expected conditions. </li>
        </ol>
